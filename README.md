# HTML and CSS website

This project was created in class as an introductory to html and css concepts. I moved it into a react-js app. The aim is to convert the static pages in a react-js app in the future. The website is meant to showacse concepts such as list, tables , blocks , links , images, etc.. in html and styles with css.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
