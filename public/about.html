<h2 id="hot" class="under">ABOUT ME</h2>

<p class="paragraphs">My name is <b>Maurice Blake</b> and my major is <b>Game Design.</b> In the future I would like to work in the video gaming industry as a game designer. I&#39;m a fan of many different gaming genres such as fighting sports, simulation, puzzle, real time strategy and adventure games. I am a driven and self-motived individual who always puts out a 100 percent. I was born on the island of Jamaica the younger of one sibling and the older of two. I&#39;m very athletic and spend my free time playing soccer. When not playing soccer I&#39;m playing video games. I decided I wanted to be a game designer because of the love I have for being creative and I enjoy troubleshooting technical problems. In quoting one of the most influential designers of our time (Steve Jobs)<blockquote>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</blockquote> I believe in this statement that being a designer comes down to how well your designs work and use this as an inspiration to achieve the best designs possible.</p>

<h2 id="reflection" class="under">Reflection: The Beginning of the Semester</h2>

<p class="paragraphs"> This semester starts with <b>Web Design</b> being a new topic for me and having never did any form of coding or attempt to make a website, I feel my <b>weakest skill</b> is not being familiar to the programs and concepts associated with web design.  Additionally I look forward to learning how to use <b>CSS, XHTML, Dreamweaver, Flash</b> and being able to fully utilizing them effectively throughout the course and future endeavors. I found that grasping the use of HTML tags and being able to incorporate them to be a slight challenge such as using subscripts (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O). As a game design major I believe being able to make websites effectively and attractively will help strengthen my career. I plan on improving on my lack of knowledge by applying myself to course material and assignments presented to make full use of the learning opportunities it provides. My <b>strongest skill</b> would definitely be my ability to be driven and my willingness to apply myself to any given task.</p>

<h2 id="middleref" class="under">Reflection: The Middle of the Semester</h2>

<p class="paragraphs"> At the midpoint of this semester I see where I&#39;m now more familiar with the basic web concepts <b>(CSS, HTML5)</b>. I&#39;m now more comfortable with using the Adobe Suite programs such as <b>Dreamweaver</b>. Throughout the classes so far I&#39;ve discovered that web design can be tedious and require you to be willing to apply yourself. I&#39;m now stronger in my approach towards my assignments, before I was a bit scared to work on my own with new material. Development is needed in utilizing design tools such as <b>Photoshop and Illustrator</b> more efficiently. I tend to struggle with using them to their full potential. My progress throughout this semester so far can be noted in my <b>Building Blocks</b>. I believe they represent the journey and understanding I&#39;ve gain on the course materials up to this point.</p>

<h2 id="middleref" class="under"> Reflection: The End of the Semester</h2>

<p class="paragraphs">

I think my most significant accomplishment this semester is being able to actually create a working webiste using HTML and CSS. I beleive this  is a major step for me because at the start of the semester I was clueless to web design and to be able to endure it&#39;s tedius learning curve. Yes, I&#39;m now closer to becoming a well-rounded game designer. Now that I&#39;m able to create websites using the basics I&#39;ve learned, I can now reach an expanded gaming market. My final project is a major achievement for me as I didnt understand alot of CSS and scripts until my last few iterations of my website.</p>
